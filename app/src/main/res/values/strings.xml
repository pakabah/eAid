    <string name="computer">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[13] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[14] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[15] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture</string>
